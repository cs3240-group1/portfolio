The age of interviewees ranged from \r\n                21 to 25 years old. The students are either from NUS Computing or NTU Engineering while the working adults\r\n                comprised of ex-colleagues.</p>\r\n                <h3>Findings</h3>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    Interviewees spent an average of 6 hours daily in front of the computer. The average amongst students was found to be \r\n                    higher than working adults due to home-based learning. Most of the interviewees stated that the main reason for them being \r\n                    desk-bound is because of school / work. However, some also stated that they use computers for leisure. \r\n                </p>\r\n                <h3>Detrimental effects</h3>\r\n                <p>\r\n                Most interviewees reported having muscle sores and back pain after spending a long time in front of the computer. Some cited having headaches \r\n                and neck stiffness as well. Some did not experience any detrimental effects, but they represent the minority.\r\n                It can be concluded that this made the interviewees more restless during sedentary periods at work / study,  and ultimately \r\n                can be seen to negatively affect their daily lifestyle.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <h3>Proposed solution <FcApproval /></h3>\r\n
