The age of interviewees ranged from \r\n                21 to 25 years old. The students are either from NUS Computing or NTU Engineering while the working adults\r\n                comprised of ex-colleagues.</p>\r\n                <h3>Findings</h3>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    Interviewees spent an average of 6 hours daily in front of the computer. The average amongst students was found to be \r\n                    higher than working adults due to home-based learning. Most of the interviewees stated that the main reason for them being \r\n                    desk-bound is because of school / work. However, some also stated that they use computers for leisure. \r\n                </p>\r\n                <h3>Detrimental effects</h3>\r\n                <p>\r\n                Most interviewees reported having muscle sores and back pain after spending a long time in front of the computer. Some cited having headaches \r\n                and neck stiffness as well. Some did not experience any detrimental effects, but they represent the minority.\r\n                It can be concluded that this made the interviewees more restless during sedentary periods at work / study,  and ultimately \r\n                can be seen to negatively affect their daily lifestyle.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <h3>Proposed solution <FcApproval /></h3>\r\n                <p>\r\n                Interviewees mentioned that having some form of reminder to prompt them to take breaks in between their working hours would be ideal. \r\n                Some suggested that having something teach them to form better habits would also be good.\r\n                </p>\r\n            </div> \r\n            <div className=\"content\">\r\n                <h2>Survey <FcList /></h2>\r\n                <p className=\"subtitle\">How did we do our surveys and what did we find?</p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    We decided to conduct survey too in order to validate the findings we obtained from the interviews.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <h3>Demographics</h3>\r\n                <p>Most of the respondents are between the age of 19 to 25 and most are students with a few office managers and graphic designers.</p>\r\n                <img className=\"contentimage\" src={DemographicsSurvey1}></img>\r\n                <p className=\"caption\">Survey result showing the age demographics</p>\r\n                <img className=\"contentimage\" src={DemographicsSurvey2}></img>\r\n                <p className=\"caption\">Survey result showing the occupation demographics</p>\r\n                <h3>Reason for being desk-bound</h3>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    We asked this question to confirm our findings from the interview that work is the main reason for people to become desk-bound.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <img className=\"contentimage\" src={ReasonSurvey1}></img>\r\n                <p className=\"caption\">This survey result confirms that assignments / work is the main reason people are desk-bound</p>\r\n                <h3>Detrimental effects</h3>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    We want to find out whether the main problems stated by our interviewees are also faced by a larger group of people.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <img className=\"contentimage src\" src={ProblemSurvey1}></img>\r\n                <p className=\"caption\">This shows that majority of people feels restless and also experiencing muscle soreness and back pain</p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    This survey result confirms that majority of people feels some sort of pain when living a sedentary lifestyle and therefore, this\r\n                    shows that the problem that we are trying to solve occurs in most people.\r\n                </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div className=\"content\">\r\n                <h2>User persona <FcRating /></h2>\r\n                <p className=\"subtitle\">What are the final findings from our study?</p>\r\n                <p>We created persona to represent the different user types that we have which are university student, and office worker.

This is reflected in the 3 distinct portions in the prototype. \r\n                </p>\r\n                <img className=\"contentimage\" style={{\r\n                    width: '60%',\r\n                    height: 'auto'\r\n                }} src={DarylHomepage}></img>\r\n                <p className=\"caption\">Screenshot of Daryl's homepage</p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                The right consists of a timeline of reminders that are set to go off that day. I figured that a user would like to see what reminders they had in the day,\r\n                as well as being able to toggle a reminder should there be a particular reminder they did not want that day. The bottom shows the \r\n                number of times a reminder has been successfully acted upon (the user has to acknowledge that they have done it), which allows them \r\n                to see their progress on that day. Lastly, the top would tell users how many types of reminders they set for the day, as well as a fun \r\n                fact of the day to enhance the user experience.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <img className=\"contentimage\" style={{\r\n                    width: '60%',\r\n                    height: 'auto'\r\n                }} src={DarylReminder}></img>\r\n                <p className=\"caption\">Screenshot of Daryl's reminder page</p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                The reminder page simply holds all the reminders set. Days are easy to toggle as I figured that users might want the flexibility \r\n                to toggle days according to their own schedule. Allowing users to customize through colour coding and choosing their own icon would \r\n                also help enhance the user experience.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <h3>Conclusion</h3>\r\n                <p>\r\n                Overall, my design is focused on making sure the interface is easy to use and pleasant to look at, and this \r\n                is reflected in the way the user flow is designed as well as the aesthetic design choices (negative space, colour palette, etc).\r\n                </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div className=\"content\">\r\n                <h2>Roby's prototype <FcReadingEbook /></h2>\r\n                <p className=\"subtitle\">What was Roby thinking when he designed his prototype?</p>\r\n                <img className=\"contentimage\" src={Roby}></img>\r\n                <p className=\"caption\">\"Sometimes the craziest idea might just work!\" -Roby</p>\r\n                <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/file/Ufk4DElMg3CPWldccEm92t/Prototyping?node-id=0%3A1\"><button style={{\r\n                    marginLeft: \"0px\"\r\n                }}>Roby's prototype</button></a>\r\n                <h3>Conception</h3>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    I wanted to make a simple desktop app with minimal features so as not to overwhelm the users. However, I want the app \r\n                    to have a personality, things like welcome messages and personalized features. I believe that having these minor elements can greatly \r\n                    increase the appeal of the application.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <h3>Designing</h3>\r\n                <p>\r\n                I settled with having 3 pages: dashboard, reminder page, and profile page.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <img className=\"contentimage\" style={{\r\n                    width: '60%',\r\n                    height: 'auto'\r\n                }} src={RobyHomepage}></img>\r\n                <p className=\"caption\">Screenshot of Roby's homepage</p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                The dashboard is meant to be the main page where users are to spend the most time in. It contains all the necessary \r\n                information for that specific usage period such as Today’s Usage statistics which shows the reminders done for today. \r\n                The dashboard also contains reminders that the users have highlighted so that the important reminders can be easily found. \r\n                </p>\r\n                <img className=\"contentimage\" style={{\r\n                    width: '60%',\r\n                    height: 'auto'\r\n                }} src={RobyReminder}></img>\r\n                <p className=\"caption\">Screenshot of Roby's reminder page</p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                The reminders page serves as a manager for the reminders. This page will display all the reminders that the user has \r\n                and also the Highlighted reminder tab which is the same as the one found in the dashboard. \r\n                The user can easily drag and drop the reminders into the Highlighted reminder tab so modify its contents. \r\n                This drag and drop feature makes reminder management a lot easier rather than clicking on individual reminders and modifying its location.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <h3>Conclusion</h3>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    Overall, I am trying to make the application as simple as possible.

Asking questions about the experience after testing also gives us insights as to what the user experience of our prototype was like.\r\n                </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div className=\"content\">\r\n                <h2>Evaluation result <FcKindle /></h2>\r\n                <p className=\"subtitle\">What did we gain from the evaluation?</p>\r\n                <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12DLhtJmQGcC1aaCNpt5a-6rzlA4dMrSom-0DmYNhWK4/edit?usp=sharing\">\r\n                    <button style={{\r\n                        marginLeft: \"0px\"\r\n                    }}>Evaluation result</button>\r\n                </a>\r\n                <h3>Main prototype</h3>\r\n                <img className=\"contentimage\" style={{\r\n                    width: '60%',\r\n                    height: 'auto'\r\n                }} src={MainHomepage}></img>\r\n                <p className=\"caption\">Screenshot of our main prototype's homepage</p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    In terms of intuitiveness, majority of the evaluators stated that it was easy to use and very straight forward. However, \r\n                    one mentioned that the feature to add reminders on the homepage is easily missed. The intuitiveness of the application is based \r\n                    on how easy it is for the evaluators to perform the tasks that we gave them.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <img className=\"contentimage\" src={AddReminder}></img>\r\n                <p className=\"caption\">Someone mentioned that the add reminder button could be removed or be made more obvious</p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    In terms of aesthetics, majority of the evaluators agreed that the color scheme is beautiful with good organization. The prototype\r\n                    looks clean with not too many components cluttering the pages. However, one mentioned that some statistics are difficult to understand\r\n                    and that the clickable buttons could be made more obvious, especially on adding reminders. \r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    In terms of user flow (display of information and ease of navigability), majority stated that they can easily identify that there are \r\n                    more than one way to add the reminders. They also mentioned that the layout is intuitive enough that they can easily switch pages without\r\n                    getting lost. \r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    We asked the evaluators whether they had any additional remarks. Majority supported the dashboard design of our homepage and appreciated the\r\n                    straight-forward design of our onboarding process. However, one mentioned that it would be great if we allow users to switch position of elements around\r\n                    to fit more people's tastes.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <h3>Alternative prototype</h3>\r\n                <p>As for alternative prototype, we used Roby's original prototype.</p>\r\n                <img className=\"contentimage\" style={{\r\n                    width: '60%',\r\n                    height: 'auto'\r\n                }} src={RobyHomepage}></img>\r\n                <p className=\"caption\">Screenshot of our alternative prototype's homepage</p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    Most evaluators had the same opinion about our alternative prototype in terms of intuitiveness however, many mentioned that the first prototype just \r\n                    feels a lot better. \r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    In terms of aesthetics, some mentioned that the choice of bright purple of the color scheme is a bit jarring which could discourage prolonged use.\r\n                    Overall, majority prefered the softer look of our main prototype. \r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    Majority agreed that while the design is simple enough to follow, it pales in comparison to the intuitiveness of our main prototype. The design\r\n                    of the layout could use some improvement and many actually did not realize that they can add reminders in the reminders page.\r\n                </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div className=\"content\">\r\n                <h2>Conclusion <FcAdvance /></h2>\r\n                <p className=\"subtitle\">What is our main takeaway from the evaluation?</p>\r\n                <p>Overall, we found out that our main prototype is doing a lot better compared to our alternative prototype, both in terms of intuitiveness\r\n                and aesthetics.
